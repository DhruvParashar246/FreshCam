## 📱 API Usage Examples

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict \
  -F "file=@banana.jpg"
```

**Returns:** Fruit name, ripeness, confidence, nutrition, environmental impact

### Full Analysis
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/predict?include_recipes=true" \
  -F "file=@banana.jpg"
```

**Returns:** Everything above + recipes + safety + storage tips

### Just Recipes

  -F "file=@strawberry.jpg"
```

**Returns:** Recipes, safety, storage (no nutrition - for faster response)

## 🔄 Restart Requirements

### ✅ **YES - You Need to Restart Backend**
Because we modified:
- `app.py` (removed pantry router)
- `routes/predict.py` (added nutrition integration)
- `services/gemini_service.py` (added nutrition function)

### How to Restart:
```bash
# Stop the current backend (Ctrl+C in the terminal)
cd backend
python app.py
```

### ⚡ **NO - Frontend Auto-Reloads**
Because:
- Frontend changes auto-reload with Expo/Metro
- Just save your files and they update
- Only removed a tab from `_layout.tsx`

If you want to be safe:
```bash
# In Expo terminal, press 'r' to reload
# OR restart:
cd frontend
npx expo start --tunnel
```
