# Gemini Service Debugging - Changes Made

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Safety Settings Error**
- **Problem**: KeyError for 'dangerous_content' in safety settings
- **Fix**: Updated to use proper HarmCategory and HarmBlockThreshold enums from Google's API
- **Result**: Backend now starts successfully

### 2. **Enhanced Logging**
Added comprehensive logging to debug Gemini API calls:

#### In `get_fruit_name()`:
- 🍎 Starting message
- Response text logging
- Error stack traces

#### In `analyze_ripeness_with_gemini()`:
- 🔍 Starting analysis message
- ✓ Image size confirmation
- 📤 Sending to API message
- 📥 Response received with full details
- Prompt feedback logging (to catch blocked responses)
- 📝 Response text display
- ✓ JSON parsing confirmation
- ✅ Final result display
- ⚠️ JSON decode failure warnings

## How to Debug

### Watch Backend Logs
When you take a photo in the app, you'll see detailed logs like:

```
🍎 Getting fruit name from Gemini...
Fruit name response: banana
✓ Fruit identified: banana
⚠️ Roboflow not available, using Gemini for ripeness detection...
🔍 Starting Gemini ripeness analysis...
✓ Image loaded: (640, 640)
📤 Sending to Gemini API...
📥 Response received: <GenerateContentResponse>
📝 Response text: {"fruit_name": "banana", "ripeness": "ripe", "confidence": 85.0}
✓ JSON parsed successfully: {...}
✅ Final result: {'fruit_name': 'banana', 'ripeness': 'ripe', 'confidence': 85.0}
```

### Common Issues to Look For:

1. **"No text in response"** → API might be blocking the request
2. **"JSON decode failed"** → Gemini returned non-JSON text
3. **Prompt feedback errors** → Safety filters blocking the image
4. **Exception traceback** → Network or API key issues

## Current Status

✅ Backend running on port 8000
✅ Gemini API configured with API key
✅ Safety settings properly configured
✅ Enhanced logging active
✅ Fallback mechanism in place

## Next Steps

1. **Take a photo** in the Expo app
2. **Watch the backend terminal** for detailed logs
3. **Look for error messages** in the logs
4. **Share the logs** if you still see "no predictions found"

The logs will tell us exactly where the Gemini API is failing (if it is).
